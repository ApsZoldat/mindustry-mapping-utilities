**My todo list**

# Main feature - Mod Menu
Things like:
* Render Settings
* Region selection
* Unit editing
* Maybe even block drawing

**Should be available when using in-game editing and playtest.**

Possible solution - making a mod menu capable of adding any amount of custom tool panels to user interface anywhere player wants (fully customizable so it won't repeat Scheme Size covering half of the user interface), opportunity to add a keybind to any of these tools

Estimated time of adding - bruh idk

# Soon (TM)
* **Objectives dialog upgrade**: Add objectives/markers copy/pasting, add zooming to the menu, make objective removal button not so dangerous to missclick

# Not soon but should be made
* **Unit editing**: Like Testing Utilities unit spawn, but inside the editor *(possible features: precise unit moving)*
* **Draw layers** *(like in any image editing software)*
* **Region selection**: Make regions used to copy/paste editor tiles *(possible features: bending generation modifiers to rectangular regions)*
* **Render settings**: Making blocks transparent, highlight ores, etc. *(i know about Scheme Size, don't remind me)*
* **Making world blocks available to build in playtest** *(should be not that hard?)*

# I think about it (but probably unnecessary)
* **Better map image in resize dialog**: Make map image in resize dialog show the new cropped/extended area
* **Custom editor hotkeys**: Add editor tools keybind settings

# DEATH (HELP ME WHY DID I THINK ABOUT THESE)
* **Polygonal brushes**: Turning brush into a hexagon or any other polygon
