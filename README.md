Small Mindustry mod improving map editor convenience and possibilities

## Improvements:

* **Mixed Tech Unlocked** *(use it wisely, please)*
* **More Rules Available**: Reveals some hidden vanilla map rules *(Custom Mode Name, Unit Posession Allowed, Show Enemy Spawns, etc.)*
* **Better Cliff Editing**: Now it's possible to draw cliffs *(almost like they are default blocks)*


**! Work In Progress !**
More map making tools will be added in future
