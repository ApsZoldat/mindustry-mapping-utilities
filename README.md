Small Mindustry mod improving map editor convenience and possibilities

## Improvements:

* Mixed Tech Unlocked ** (use it wisely, please) **
* More rules available: Reveals some hidden vanilla map rules (Custom Mode Name, Unit Posession Allowed, Show Enemy Spawns, etc.)
* Better cliff editing: Now it's possible to draw cliffs like they are default blocks.


** ! Work In Progress ! **
More map making tools will be added in future
