Small Mindustry mod improving map editor convenience and possibilities

## Improvements:

* **Mixed Tech Unlocked** *(use it wisely, please)*
* **More Rules Available**: Reveals some hidden vanilla map rules *(Custom Mode Name, Unit Posession Allowed, Show Enemy Spawns, etc.)*
* **Better Cliff Editing**: Now it's possible to draw cliffs *(almost like they are default blocks)*
* **Numbered Teams Editing**: Now it's possible to place any numbered team blocks *(teams from 0 to 255)*
* **Planet Background**: Allows to edit planet background rendered on map *(yes, it's still just hidden vanilla features)*

**! Work In Progress !**
More map making tools will be added in future
